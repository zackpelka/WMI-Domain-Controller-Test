# WMI-Domain-Controller-Test
This script will try to connect to the domain controller using the WMI module and query the operating system information. 
If the connection is successful, it will print the OS name and version. If the connection fails, it will print the error code. 
You can run this script on any machine that has Python and the WMI module installed. You can also modify the script to test
other WMI queries or classes. For more information about WMI, you can refer to the [Microsoft documentation]. 

I hope this helps. =)
